His credits include a 1994 hosting gig on "Saturday Night Live," and a guest appearance as himself in a 2008 episode of the HBO series "Entourage."

Later, Patric dated Danielle Schreiber in a relationship that was on and off for about a decade. During this time, the couple conceived a son via in vitro fertilization. Patric and Schreiber split in 2012.</p><p>Following the pair's separation, it was ruled that Patric had no custody rights to his son, as his unmarried status to Schreiber rendered him only a sperm donor. He subsequently sued for parental rights, but lost the case. However, the case was later sent back to court, and in 2014, Patric was legally recognized as the father of his son. Due to his struggles, Patric lobbied the California legislature to afford parental rights to sperm donors.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue9GimqGdo6l6pLHLnpmroaSesrR7wJyrqKqjZLeiv86nZKmZpKe2pHnNnqtmr5%2Bnwal7</p></div><div id=links><a href=./the-xbox-series-x-is-still-in-stock-at-these-sites.html>&#171;&nbsp;The Xbox Series X is still in stock at these sites</a>
