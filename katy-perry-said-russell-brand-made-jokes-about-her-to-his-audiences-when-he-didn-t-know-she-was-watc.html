Because of this, Perry said she occasionally dropped in at Brand’s shows to surprise him. When he didn’t know she was in the audience, though, he made jokes about her.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Katy-Perry-Russell-Brand-1.webp?strip=all&quality=80"><p id=par-3_44>“[He was] hysterical in some ways,” Perry told <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Vogue</a> in 2013. “Until he started making jokes about me and he didn’t know I was in the audience, because I had come to surprise him at one of his shows. So. Hysterical to a point.”</p><p id=par-4_15>After they divorced, Brand continued to joke about his marriage and sex life with Perry.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-katy-perry-said-russell-brand-didn-t-like-seeing-her-in-a-position-of-power>Katy Perry said Russell Brand didn’t like seeing her in a position of power</h2><p id=par-5_35>Perry believed that the breakdown of her marriage had a great deal to do <a href=#>with her career</a>. While Brand said he wanted an equal partner, she thought he disliked watching her thrive in her work.</p><p id=par-6_51>“At first when I met him he wanted an equal, and I think a lot of times strong men do want an equal, but then they get that equal and they’re like, I can’t handle the equalness,” she said. “He didn’t like the atmosphere of me being the boss on tour.”</p><p id=par-7_19>She admitted that she blamed herself for the split, but was eventually able to let go of this feeling.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-8_72>“So that was really hurtful, and it was very controlling, which was upsetting,” she said. “I felt a lot of responsibility for it ending, but then I found out the real truth, which I can’t necessarily disclose because I keep it locked in my safe for a rainy day. I let go and I was like: This isn’t because of me; this is beyond me.

The marriage didn’t last for a very long time, and I think that is to do with the undulated nature of fame and that, living in those conditions and what was happening.”</p><p id=par-11_20>In the years <a href=#>after her divorce</a>, Perry entered into a relationship with Orlando Bloom, with whom she shares a child.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS4osDYZqeeqqKuerStyJ1kq62jqLKtuIybqZqmlGK3sLfErGSarZSesq%2BvxKxkpKafrHq4rdOcn6Kml2O1tbnLaA%3D%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./mike-matusow-net-worth-celebrity-net-worth.html>&#171;&nbsp;Mike Matusow Net Worth | Celebrity Net Worth</a>
