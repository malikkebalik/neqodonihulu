The disease was transmitted by fleas that infested rats, which were common in urban environments. In an attempt to protect themselves, some doctors wore a distinctive outfit that has become synonymous with the plague: the beaked mask and long coat. While the beaked mask was not an effective defense against the plague, the outfit did provide some protection against fleas. The coat was made of a thick, waxed fabric that made it difficult for fleas to bite through, while the gloves and boots covered the skin and prevented fleas from biting. The mask was filled with aromatic compounds which were believed to offer protection against “poisoned air”, but in reality, these compounds were not effective against the disease. Despite its limitations, the Plague Doctor’s outfit is a fascinating example of how people in the past attempted to protect themselves against disease. Today, we have much more effective methods of disease prevention, but the Plague Doctor’s outfit remains a powerful symbol of the fear and desperation caused by one of the deadliest pandemics in human history. <a title=disease href=# rel="nofollow noopener">#Disease</a> <a title=fleas href=# rel="nofollow noopener">#Fleas</a> <a title=protection href=# rel="nofollow noopener">#Protection</a> <a title=herbs href=# rel="nofollow noopener">#Herbs</a> <a title=outfit href=# rel="nofollow noopener">#Outfit</a> <a title=fear href=# rel="nofollow noopener">#Fear</a> <a title=diseaseprevention href=# rel="nofollow noopener">#DiseasePrevention</a> <a title=symbol href=# rel="nofollow noopener">#Symbol</a> <a title=iconic href=# rel="nofollow noopener">#Iconic</a> <a title=ravagedeurope href=# rel="nofollow noopener">#RavagedEurope</a> <a title=urbanenvironments href=# rel="nofollow noopener">#UrbanEnvironments</a> <a title=transmission href=# rel="nofollow noopener">#Transmission</a> <a title=bacteria href=# rel="nofollow noopener">#Bacteria</a></p><p><a title="♬ original sound - History Unleashed" href=# rel="nofollow noopener">♬ original sound – History Unleashed</a></p><p>The world of motorsport is in mourning as it bids farewell to a true legend.
