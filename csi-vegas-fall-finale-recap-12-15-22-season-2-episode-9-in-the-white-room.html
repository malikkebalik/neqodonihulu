Josh, Allie, and Penny were called in because two of their victims were attending an event in the city for regency romance lovers. Think “Bridgerton”! The female victim was chased while wearing a corset as well as a slim long dress.</p><p>But oddly the female victim was with the male victim right before his death. She was found out by the golf course. He was found inside a photo booth. The forensic investigators found the photo still at the photo booth. It seems someone shot the male victim by shooting him through the privacy curtain in the photo booth. And the female victim witnessed all of this and that’s why she was ultimately chased down and then murdered on top of it.</p><p>When the other kind of investigators stepped in, they thought the murders were tied to the female victim. Her name was Shelby Winslow. She was all over the guy that died a mere moment before she did and Shelby was married. Her husband didn’t attend the event. He thought it was all lame.</p><p>He also didn’t seem to be angry about his wife partying with a bunch of other guys because he said he had nothing to fear from a man wearing a powdered wig. The husband was also busy identifying his wife’s body when a third body dropped. The third victim was a known face. It was Lamont. He was the young man who almost got killed, but the detectives were able to chase away the killer.</p><p>Well, Lamont’s luck finally wore out. He was killed with the same odd gun that the other two were. They were killed by a bolt gun. But the first victim was Clarence and he might have been killed by mistake. The forensic team was able to map it out. The killer approached Lamont first. Lamont worked at the regency event.</p><p>He gave back a good fight and drenched his killer in bleach before he managed to run away. Leaving the killer to be blurry-eyed and mistaking Clarence for Lamont. They did look alike. They both were black, with beards, and were around the same build. And so it wasn’t until the killer got Clarence that Shelby ran away and then he had to fix his mistake.</p><p>The killer handled the eyewitness. He also went back to the event to get Lamont’s place of address and that’s how he was able to track down Lamont. But Lamont wasn’t innocent. Lamont was being blackmailed and the blackmailer wanted Lamont to commit murder for them. Allie and Josh found that out by finding Lamont’s secret compartment in his room. He had apparently unscrewed the pipe in his bathroom and hid his stuff there. Lamont like a few other people known to the forensics team was once treated by Dr. Leo Sarkisian. Then they also got a letter a few years later about keeping secrets and culling the rotten fruit.</p><p>It was a nice way of blackmailing someone until they commit murder.</p><p>Lamont was supposed to kill Albert Santoni. Only Albert chose to kill himself after he got caught for killing someone else in the group. Lamont’s situation went away and so someone wasn’t happy about that. They either went after Lamont themselves or sent another person to go after Lamont. So, Maxine and Catherine went to the psych ward. They interviewed the last man that wanted Lamont dead, Alan. Alan was pretty much out of it when they got there and he didn’t seem to want to help. It wasn’t until they showed him the letter that Lamont got that it stirred up something in Alan. He suffered a psychotic break about not finishing the mission. Or in his case not killing Lamont.</p><p>Allie and Detective Chavez meanwhile were looking into other people connected to this group. They found Richard and they tried to talk to Richard, but he was too interested in killing them because he said that’s what “Basilisk” wanted him to do. They were forced to defend themselves. They seriously injured Richard.</p><p>He was bleeding out and he still couldn’t stop talking about how he failed the Basilisk. The Basilisk was a rumored AI from the future that demanded people help them or risk their wrath. But this Basilisk figure only made sure to contact people with serious mental health issues. She or he convinces them to go off their medication and to kill to make them happy or else all their secrets will be revealed.</p><p>The Basilisk wants people to commit murders. They want people to die in their names. The Basilisk was very dangerous and he infected all of his victims’ computers and tablets with malware that allows him to take over and one laptop got him a photo of Maxine, Catherine, and Penny.</p><p>THE END!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmdoaKpxq2t1Kebq7FemLyue5FpaWtnk6i2bsLEoJisZZaWua15xaKlmqSVYr%2Bmr8CpZGpqXWaCbn6RZqqemaOku25%2BjJ6noqufmbJuhYyipWasmJp6uLTIrZxmqp%2BkunA%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./do-pepper-plants-need-tomato-cages.html>&#171;&nbsp;Do pepper plants need tomato cages?</a>
