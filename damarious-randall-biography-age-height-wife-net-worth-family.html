Both ejections would stain the Cleveland Browns’ 21-7 win over the Steelers.</p><p>Early in his tenure with the Browns, Randall incited anger from Clevelanders by openly cheering for the Golden State Warriors to defeat the hometown Cavs in the NBA Finals. As a make-good, he offered to purchase jerseys for everyone who retweeted one of his posts if the Cavs did indeed go on to win the championship (they did not win).
