That is a combined net worth with her husband of more than two decades, television super-producer <a href=#>David E. Kelley</a>. David E. Kelley is one of just a handful of producers in history who have created shows for all four major American television networks: ABC, CBS, Fox and NBC. His shows include:</p><ul><li>Picket Fences</li><li>Chicago Hope</li><li>The Practice</li><li>Ally McBeal</li><li>Boston Public</li><li>Big Little Lies</li><li>The Lincoln Lawyer</li><li>Goliath</li><li>Big Sky</li></ul><p>Michelle Pfeiffer's career began in the late 1970s with minor television roles, but she quickly rose to prominence in the 1980s with breakout roles in films like "Scarface" (1983), where she portrayed Elvira Hancock, a performance that solidified her as a talented actress. Pfeiffer's versatility and charisma led her to a variety of roles in different genres, ranging from drama to romantic comedies. Her portrayal of Catwoman in "Batman Returns" (1992) is particularly noteworthy, earning her critical acclaim and solidifying her status as a Hollywood icon.</p><p>Throughout her career, Pfeiffer has been recognized for her exceptional talent, receiving multiple award nominations, including three Academy Award nominations for her roles in "Dangerous Liaisons" (1988), "The Fabulous Baker Boys" (1989), and "Love Field" (1992). Her performance in "The Fabulous Baker Boys," where she starred opposite <a href=# title="Jeff Bridges Net Worth">Jeff Bridges</a>, is often cited as one of her best, showcasing her ability to blend sensuality and strength.</p><p>Pfeiffer's career has also been marked by her ability to successfully navigate the transition from leading lady to character actress, with impressive performances in films like "Hairspray" (2007) and "Mother!" (2017).</p><p>As an actress, Michelle is known for appearing in movies such as "Scarface," "Dangerous Minds," "Batman Returns," and "Dangerous Liaisons." She has been nominated for three Oscars during her career to date.</p><h2 id=notable-salaries><strong>Notable Salaries</strong></h2><p>Michelle earned $3 million for her role in 1991's "Frankie and Johnny," which co-starred <a href=# title="Al Pacino Net Worth">Al Pacino</a>.

Before Michelle's career took off, she trained to be a court reporter. One of Michelle's early roles was on the television show Fantasy Island. Even though Michelle Pfeiffer easily came to worldwide fame, with her rare beauty and talent, she hardly ever went out of her way to revel in her A-celeb status.</p><h2 id=success><strong>Success</strong></h2><p>Having dabbled in acting and modeling, Pfeiffer made her film debut the 1980 comedy The Hollywood Knights. Her first mainstream attention came with her performance in crime-drama Scarface three years later. Soon she landed more film and TV roles, three of which garnered her Academy Award nominations for Best Supporting Actress in Dangerous Liaisons (1988) and Best Actress in The Fabulous Baker Boys (1989) and Love Field (1992). But it was her offbeat turn as Catwoman in Batman Returns (1992) that established Pfeiffer as a bona fide star, a position she firmly cemented with her performance in What Lies Beneath (2000), and Hairspray (2007). Other notable roles include The Witches of Eastwick (1987), Married to the Mob (1988), The Age of Innocence (1993), Wolf (1994), Dangerous Minds (1995) and I Am Sam (2001).</p><p>She took a break from acting from 2002 until 2007 when she returned to star in the musical Hairspray.</p><p>During her career to date, Michelle has won a number of prominent awards.
