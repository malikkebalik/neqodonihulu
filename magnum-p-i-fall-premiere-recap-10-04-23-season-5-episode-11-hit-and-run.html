She was dating Thomas Magnum. She really liked Magnum and so thankfully her short stay in the hotel room was all part of a story. A story that Jin was telling. He apparently decided that writing a book was easy.</p><p>He wanted to pitch Robyn a story about the White Knight. He even wanted to give Magnum’s character some magical powers. He hasn’t finished the story when Magnum interrupted him. He said that he doubted Robyn would move into the supernatural. And Jin said that was okay because he has another book idea though truthfully all he had was a book cover.</p><p>The book cover was of a buffed out Jin. Jin simply wants to give the cover to Robyn and hopes Robyn writes a story about him. Only that’s not how writing works. Magnum told Jin as much. The only good thing Jin’s stories were for was putting Rick’s infant daughter to sleep. Rick later thanked him for that.</p><p>He also told his friends that Kumu believes they should fan out their visits to see TC. They didn’t want to overwhelm him now that he was out of the hospital. Their good friend TC was paralyzed in a shooting. There was a chance he might regain function and there was also a chance that he might be paralyzed for life. Time will tell</p><p>In the meantime, TC hasn’t given up hope. Neither have the rest of them. They made sure TC was at a great veterans’ rehab facility. He was learning to adapt to his life in a wheelchair there. Shammy was helping him. The others were just offering support the best way they could.</p><p>Or they were until Magnum caught a case. The private investigator took a mysterious call from a new client. This client didn’t reveal their name. Or anything about him. All he was willing to say on the call was that he was a hitman. He gets hired to kill people. He has no problem with doing so. And he had just one rule.</p><p>This hitman doesn’t kill children. Someone hired him to kill a twelve year old girl. He turned them down only he knows that they will hire someone else to do it. The hitman hired Magnum and Higgins to save the girl. He said he knew they would take the job knowing the risks.</p><p>They were that kind of people. They would never let anyone kill a kid and neither was the hitman. The hitman bowed out after he gave them the information. He told them that he’ll never contact them again. And so the two PIs went looking for the girl.</p><p>This case became personal for Higgins. Higgins believes she might be pregnant. She wasn’t sure. She wanted to check after they were finished with the case and Magnum kinda wanted to check right away. He was both worrying and eager. He couldn’t decide what emotion he wanted to feel. Only this case did take up their time. They tracked down where the girl lives. Her name is Anna Park. She lives with her teacher who was also her guardian. The guardian’s name is Margaret Neely. Margaret was hit by a car a few minutes before the private investigators made it to her house.</p><p>They were wondering if that was a coincidence when they ran into the new hitman. The new hitman was later identified as Clint Watt. He goes by the nickname of the Ghost. He took the job to kill Anna and when he couldn’t find her at her house – he waited to question Margaret. She ran out screaming. She then got hit by a car and was taken to the hospital. Watt came back around in the hope that Anna would come home. He instead ran into Magnum and Higgins. They fought him. He got away. They used the blood he spilt on Magnum’s ring to identify him.</p><p>Then they called Gordie. Gordie told them Watt’s name. He also mentioned he was on the FBI Most Wanted List. He and HPD were going to look for Watt on the island. Higgins got evidence that Anna was on a different island. It was outside HPD’s jurisdiction. So, Magnum and Higgins went there. They ran into Xavier and Anna. Xavier was the hitman that hired them to save her. He must have thought they were taking too long because he made sure to get to Anna first. He took her to an island off the grid. He was still with her when Mangum and Higgins pulled up.</p><p>Magnum and Higgins had figured out who was behind the hit. The person that ordered the hit was Jimmy Lyons Jr. His father had just died and the son learned that he has a sibling. A half-sibling that can take half of their evangelist money from the big family church. The brother now wants to kill his younger sister. Xavier got in the way of that. He rescued Anna and then they were followed by Watt. Watt killed Xavier. Magnum killed Watt. And now they can use these deaths to charge Anna’s half brother for murder in the first degree.</p><p>Now Anna was safe. She was also richer now that can access her full half of her father’s estate. But Magnum and Higgins kept digging into Xavier. He had a clean record. He bounced around in foster care and that’s why he developed his rule of never killing children.</p><p>Magnum and Higgins got Anna somewhere safe while they had a drink. Higgins wasn’t pregnant after all. But she does love Magnum and he loves her too. And there at La Mariana was Rick’s new crush, Piper. Who will soon be joined by TC and the others. TC began having feels in his legs and he was so happy to tell everyone.</p><p>THE END!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmdoaKpxq2t1Kebq7FemLyue5FpaWxnnZa0r8HMZqdmoV2brq24jKmpnqWZmr%2BmedGempqoXWZ9bnyTZmlsZaOarrS7zWZsZp2gnsCwsMRmaGplmJ7Bbq3NnWSrrZ5k</p></div><div id=links><a href=./reese-witherspoon-celebrates-her-sag-gg-noms-in-balenciaga-pretty-in-pink.html>&#171;&nbsp;Reese Witherspoon celebrates her SAG &amp;amp; GG noms in Balenciaga: pretty in pink?</a>
