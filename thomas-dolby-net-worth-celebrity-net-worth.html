A Dinosaur's Story" (1993), and "The Gate to the Mind's Eye" (1994) as well as the video game soundtracks "Double Switch" (1993), "Cyberia" (1994), "The Dark Eye" (1995), and "Obsidian" (1997).

In the mid-1970s, Thomas studied at Abingdon School in Oxfordshire, England, and he completed his A Levels there. In a 2012 interview with OneDublin.org, Dolby said of his early experiences with music, "I sang in a choir when I was 10 or 11, and learned to sight-read single lines, but other than that I don't have a formal education. I picked up the guitar initially, playing folk tunes â€“ Dylan â€“ then I graduated to piano when I got interested in jazz, listening to people like Oscar Peterson, <a href=# title="Dave Brubeck Net Worth">Dave Brubeck</a>, Bill Evans, Thelonious Monk, and so on. The first electronic instruments started to become accessible in the mid-70s and I got my hands on a kit built synthesizer and never looked back."</p><h2 id=career><strong>Career</strong></h2><p>Dolby released his debut album, "The Golden Age of Wireless," in May 1982, and it reached #8 on Canada's "RPM" chart and #13 on the "Billboard" 200 chart.
