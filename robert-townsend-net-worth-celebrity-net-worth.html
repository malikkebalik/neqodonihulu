Robert Townsend is known for directing and starring in such films as "Hollywood Shuffle," "The Meteor Man," and "The Five Heartbeats," as well as various stand-up comedy specials. He is also well-known for co-creating and starring on the 90s television sitcom "The Parent 'Hood." Townsend has made many other notable appearances over the years, including in the films "A Soldier's Story," "Odd Jobs," and "The Mighty Quinn."</p><h2 id=early-life-education><strong>Early Life and Education</strong></h2><p>Robert Townsend was born on February 6, 1957 in Chicago, Illinois as the second of four children of Ed and Shirley. He was raised by his mother on the city's West Side, where he went to Austin High School as a teenager. It was during that time Townsend developed his interest in acting. He soon caught the attention of Chicago's Experimental Black Actors Guild, for which he did a number of auditions. Townsend also performed in local plays and studied improv at the Second City. After graduating from high school in 1975, he attended Illinois State University for a year, and then moved to New York City to join the Negro Ensemble Company. Townsend ultimately chose to leave school to pursue a full-time acting career.</p><h2 id=career-beginnings-on-film><strong>Career Beginnings on Film</strong></h2><p>Townsend began appearing on the big screen in 1975 when he had an uncredited part in the coming-of-age film "Cooley High." He followed that with another brief appearance in the 1976 blaxploitation film "The Monkey Hustle." In the 80s, Townsend had bigger supporting roles in such films as "Streets of Fire," "A Soldier's Story," "American Flyers," and "Ratboy." Two of his most substantial parts were in "Odd Jobs," in which he starred alongside <a href=#>Paul Reiser</a>, and "The Mighty Quinn," in which he starred opposite <a href=#>Denzel Washington</a>.</p><h2 id=film-directing><strong>Film Directing</strong></h2><p>Townsend launched his career as a film director with the 1987 satirical comedy "Hollywood Shuffle," which he also co-wrote and starred in. Reflecting the difficulties he faced coming up in the film industry as a black actor, the movie was a significant hit. Robert spent $60,000 of his own to make Hollywood Shuffle. He would go on to earn a significant windfall when the movie earned $5 million at the box office.</p><p>Townsend next directed the stand-up comedy film "<a href=#>Eddie Murphy</a> Raw," which was an even bigger success. His third film as director was the 1991 musical drama "The Five Heartbeats," about the titular fictional R&B vocal group. Townsend also co-wrote and starred in the film. Two years after that, he wrote, directed, and starred in the superhero comedy "The Meteor Man," one of the first superhero films focused on a black character. The final theatrical film directed by Townsend in the 90s was the female buddy comedy "B.A.P.S," starring <a href=#>Halle Berry</a>, <a href=# title="Natalie Desselle Net Worth">Natalie Desselle</a>, and <a href=# title="Martin Landau Net Worth">Martin Landau</a>.</p><p>In the early 00s, Townsend directed his first non-comedy film, the crime drama "Black Listed."
