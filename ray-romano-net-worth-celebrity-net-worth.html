Ray Romano is best known for his role on the hit television sitcom Everybody Loves Raymond. Romano's down-to-earth humor and relatable family dynamics earned him accolades and a loyal fan base, making Everybody Loves Raymond one of the most popular sitcoms of its time.</p><p>Romano's journey in the entertainment industry began with stand-up comedy. In 1990, he competed in the Johnnie Walker Comedy Search and his performance caught the attention of talk show host <a href=# title="David Letterman Net Worth">David Letterman</a>, which later led to the development of Everybody Loves Raymond. The show aired from 1996 to 2005, with Romano playing the lead role of Raymond Barone. His performance won him an Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Comedy Series.</p><p>In addition to his success on television, Romano has also made significant strides in film and voice acting. He voiced the character of Manny in the animated Ice Age film series, demonstrating his versatility as an actor. On the big screen, Romano has worked with renowned directors like <a href=# title="Martin Scorsese Net Worth">Martin Scorsese</a> in The Irishman and has taken a dramatic turn in the series Parenthood and Vinyl.</p><p>Romano has also returned to his roots in stand-up comedy, with his special Right Here, Around the Corner released on Netflix in 2019. It was his first stand-up special in 23 years, and it was received positively, showcasing Romano's enduring talent in the world of comedy.</p><h2 id=highest-paid-actor-episode-salary><strong>Highest Paid Actor/Episode Salary</strong></h2><p>Ray's salary per episode of Everybody Loves Raymond for the first four seasons isn't known but starting in season five he earned $800,000 per episode. That works out to roughly $19 million per season, in seasons 5, 6 and 7. That's <strong>$57 million</strong> from these three seasons alone. If you assume he made just $300,000 for the first four seasons, that would be an additional <strong>$30 million</strong>.</p><p>For the final two seasons of his show, Ray earned what was then a record-breaking $1.75 million per episode. That was enough to make him the highest paid television actor in history up to that point. His record was broken in 2019 when both <a href=# title="Jennifer Aniston Net Worth">Jennifer Aniston</a> and <a href=# title="Reese Witherspoon Net Worth">Reese Witherspoon</a> earned $2 million a piece per episode of The Morning Show. However, when you adjust for inflation, Ray's $1.75 million is the same as around $2.3 million per episode today. Through this lens, Ray Romano is&nbsp; the highest-paid actor in television history as of this writing.</p><p>Using the $1.75 million number, Ray earned <strong>$40 million</strong> off season 8 of his show. He earned <strong>$28 million</strong> on the shorter final season the following year. And keep in mind, these amounts are base acting and production salaries alone. Ray owns part of the backend points on the show which has already allowed him to earn tens of millions from syndication deals to date. He will continue to earn millions from syndication for years to come. But just looking at those in-production earnings:</p><p>$30 + $57 + $40 + $28 = <strong>$155 million</strong> in base salary (before taxes) just from Raymond.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-350633 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-900x/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Ray-Romano.jpg alt width=900 height=603 sizes="(max-width: 1501px) 100vw, 1501px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-350633 class=wp-caption-text>(Photo by Frazer Harrison/Getty Images)</p><h2 id=early-life><strong>Early Life</strong></h2><p>Raymond Albert Romano was born on December 21st of 1957 in Queens, New York.
