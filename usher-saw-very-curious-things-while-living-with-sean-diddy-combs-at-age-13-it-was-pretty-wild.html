Combs allegedly called Usher’s experience “Puffy Flavor Camp.”</p><p id=par-4_33>“In the ’90s, do you understand what that’s like?” Usher explained. “It was curious. I got a chance to see some things. I went there to see the lifestyle. And I saw it.”</p><p id=par-5_23>Usher was just 13 years old when he lived with Diddy, and he noted that he didn’t fully “understand” what he was witnessing.</p><p id=par-6_23>“It was pretty wild,” he added. “It was crazy. … There were very curious things taking place, and I didn’t necessarily understand it.”</p><p id=par-7_24>Usher named several other high-profile stars he met at Combs’ home, including Biggie Smalls, Lil’ Kim, Craig Mack, Mary J.

He shares Usher V and Naviyd with his ex-wife, Tameka Foster, and Sovereign and Sire with his wife, Jenn Goicoechea. While on The Late Late Show With James Corden, Usher reflected on what really mattered in his life after having two children born during the height of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic.</p><p id=par-13_45>“I think everybody’s had the opportunity to take a beat back and realize what really matters in this time —&nbsp;it’s family,” Usher said, according to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">People</a>. “It is coming closer to your loved ones and appreciating the ones that you have while you have them.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-homeland-security-raided-p-diddy-s-homes-on-march-25-2024>Homeland Security raided P.

Federal agents searched his Los Angeles and Miami homes on Monday. The searches are reportedly connected to an investigation in New York.</p><p id=par-15_58>It’s unclear if the Homeland Security raid connects to past allegations against P. Diddy. Combs’ ex-girlfriend, Casandra Elizabeth Ventura, better known as Cassie, filed a case against him in 2023, claiming that he put her through years of sexual violence. The case was settled one day after its filing. Combs denied the allegations set forth by Ventura.</p><p id=par-16_9>Elements of this story were originally reported by <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">PBS</a>.</p><p id=par-17_32><strong>How to get help:</strong>&nbsp;In the U.S., call the RAINN National Sexual Assault Telephone Hotline at 1-800-656-4673 to connect with a trained staff member from a sexual assault service provider in your area.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-18_15>For more on the entertainment world and exclusive interviews, subscribe to&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Showbiz Cheat Sheet’s YouTube channel</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGTCtLTEq2SsmadisLa%2ByKisrGWknbavs9Jmo6KumaO0br%2FEmqVmnJmZsbp5wqikm6tdlrSmeZBsZKmqlanBunnWoqOdZpipuq17</p></div><div id=links><a href=./who-is-quarterback-marcus-mariota-s-wife-kiyomi-cook.html>&#171;&nbsp;Who Is Quarterback Marcus Mariota's Wife Kiyomi Cook?</a>
